ABOUT TORVUS RELOADED BATCH FILE BUILDER FOR TES V: SKYRIM

Torvus is THE batch file builder for Skyrim. Supporting targeted scripts and a whole bunch else, you'll 
spit out a batch file capable of putting any mod to the test. As of 4/21/16, Torvus has been renamed Torvus
Reloaded, as it is far better and far better designed than its predecessor. Along with the newly designed 
interface, TR contains support for better targeted scripts as well as more commands. IncPcs command is 
selectable in the menu and just general fixes. Also included is a logging subroutine that records just about 
everything the program does in case of a bug. There is an option to view the log in the Help menu.

PLEASE DL AND ENDORSE! :) Thanx!

In order to accomplish the new release, Torvus is going to be completely redesigned from the ground up,
and I have a few more surprises in addition to what I've already listed here for new features. 

Would be nice to develop this application professionally for Bethesda Softworks to be incorporated into 
the next Creation Kit... Todd Howard, I'm looking at you, good sir... As always, bug reports and suggestions 
on the forum below or hit me up at exobarf@gmail.com.

Breath and Focus,
Bane


Can YOU think of a feature that Torvus lacks? Shoot me an email at exobarf@gmail.com or leave a post on 
the discussion below. I really want to make this program better.

The current version has a custom list editor, searchable lists as well as other bells and whistles. Any bugs 
post in the discussion threads or send me an email. exobarf@gmail.com

Torvus Reloaded is licensed under the GPL, but if you would be so kind as to notify me if you make changes, 
I'd like to see what they are.

Cheers!
